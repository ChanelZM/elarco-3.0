# Elarco 2.0
## Introduction
This repo is about the second version of the Elarco website I made with achos. There was a total new homepage design, that I didn't want to implement in the old version, because that version was made desktop first. This version will be mobile first.

Elarco is an industrial design company based in Barcelona and runned by two people. They came to achos for a new website where they can show their projects and other information for their potential clients. The Elarco website won't be made with Wordpress but will be written from the ground up with HTML, CSS and JS.
